# Clash Royale AI

This project is an AI for playing **Clash Royale** using machine learning techniques. The AI interacts with the game by recognizing the current state of the game (e.g., elixir, cards, tower health) and making decisions based on a trained model. The goal is to make the AI capable of playing the game autonomously by predicting the next best actions.

## Features

- **Game State Recognition**: Captures the gameâ€™s current state by taking screenshots and analyzing them.
- **AI Model**: Uses a trained machine learning model to predict the best actions based on the current game state.
- **Auto-Play**: The AI can automatically play the game by simulating clicks and actions based on the model's predictions.
- **Customizable Models**: Ability to train different models and use them within the system.
